            <p>In 2022 my mission is to become a great web developer
                and become a contributing human to this world. Because of COvid and other reasons last year wasn't as
                easy as I thought.
                but now It's time to move forward.

            <p>Java is considered harder to learn than Python but easier than C or C++, according to CodingNomads. The
                main reason is that Java improved on C, and Python improved on Java. On the plus side, once you master
                Java, learning something like Python will be much easier. Anyone who wants to pursue a career as a
                general software engineer or mobile developer and doesn't mind the challenge would do well to study
                Java.</p>

            <p>One popular language described in the report is SQL. Not listed among the top 10, as it's more a querying
                language than a programming language, SQL boasted more job postings than all the other languages on the
                list in both the U.S. and Europe. No matter what programming language you use, you'll typically use SQL
                to talk to databases. Therefore, learning this language is a good idea for most software developers.</p>
